The CLI entry point now uses commander's declarative API for defining commands and options.\n\n### Files changed\n- src/index.ts: Replaced custom parseArgs function with commander Command API\n\n### Learnings\n\n**Patterns discovered:**\n- Commander simplifies CLI creation with a declarative API: `.command()`, `.description()`, `.argument()`, `.option()`, `.action()`\n- Commander automatically generates help output with proper formatting\n- The shebang `#!/usr/bin/env bun` was already in place from previous implementation\n- Commands can accept both positional arguments (`.argument()`) and options (`.option()`)\n- Commander's `.parse()` method handles all argument parsing automatically\n\n**Gotchas encountered:**\n- The existing implementation had a custom argument parser that needed complete replacement\n- Had to preserve the existing command handlers (handleCreate, handleInit, handleSync, handleDetect)\n- Need to ensure option types match what the command handlers expect\n- Commander uses `-V` (uppercase) for version by default, not `-v`\n\n**Code reduction:**\n- Reduced from 166 lines to 83 lines by replacing custom parsing logic with commander\n- Eliminated parseArgs function, showVersion, and showHelp in favor of commander's built-in functionality\n\n---\n## ✓ Iteration 2 - US-002: Create CLI entry point with commander\n*2026-01-19T11:16:07.881Z (129s)*\n\n**Status:** Completed\n\n**Notes:**\nimplemented with commander in src/index.ts:50-80\\n\\n✅ **Running 'bun src/index.ts --help' shows all commands**\\n   - Verified: Help output shows all commands: create, init, sync, detect\\n\\n✅ **bun run typecheck passes**\\n   - Verified: Exit code 0\\n\\n✅ **bun run lint passes**\\n   - Verified: Exit code 0 (15 warnings but no errors)\\n\\n✅ **bun run format passes**\\n   - Verified: Exit code 0\\n\\nAll acceptance criteria met! Changes committed and learnings documented in `.ralph-tui/progress.md`.\\n\\n\n\n---\n\n## [2026-01-19] - US-003\n\n### What was implemented\nCreated logger utilities wrapping @clack/prompts for consistent CLI output. The logger module provides a clean, well-typed API for common CLI interactions used throughout the codebase.\n\n### Files changed\n- src/utils/logger.ts: Created with exports for intro, outro, spin, log (info/success/warn/error), confirm, select, multiselect, and helper functions\n\n### Learnings\n\n**Patterns discovered:**\n- The codebase uses `import * as p from \"@clack/prompts\"` consistently across all files\n- @clack/prompts provides these key functions:\n  - `intro()/outro()`: Start/end CLI sections\n  - `spinner()`: Loading state with start/stop/message methods\n  - `log.info/success/warn/error/message()`: Logging with severity\n  - `confirm()`: Yes/no prompts\n  - `select()`: Single-choice selection with options array\n  - `multiselect()`: Multi-choice selection with initialValues support\n  - `isCancel()`: Check if user cancelled a prompt\n  - `note()`: Display titled notes\n  - `cancel()`: Display cancellation messages\n- The pattern is to re-export functions directly rather than wrapping them in classes\n- TypeScript interfaces document the options structures for type safety\n- Added a convenience `spin()` function to wrap async operations with spinners\n\n**Gotchas encountered:**\n- @clack/prompts was already installed (v0.11.0), no dependency changes needed\n- The spinner requires explicit start/stop calls, so the `spin()` helper is useful\n- Select/multiselect options use `{ value, label, hint }` structure consistently\n\n---\n## ✓ Iteration 3 - US-003: Create logger utilities with @clack/prompts\n*2026-01-19T11:18:46.029Z (157s)*\n\n**Status:** Completed\n\n**Notes:**\nSelectOptions, MultiSelectOptions)\\n3. **Additional utilities**: Included bonus exports like isCancel, cancel, note, text, and password for completeness\\n4. **Convenience helper**: Added a `spin()` function that wraps async operations with spinners automatically\\n5. **Quality checks**: All tests pass (typecheck, lint, format)\\n6. **Documentation**: Well-documented with JSDoc comments and learnings recorded in progress.md\\n7. **Committed**: Changes committed with proper commit message format\\n\\n\n\n---\n\n## [2026-01-19] - US-004\n\n### What was implemented\nCreated exec utilities wrapping execa for consistent shell command execution. The module provides a typed API for running shell commands with automatic stdout/stderr capture and typed error handling.\n\n### Files changed\n- src/utils/exec.ts: Created with exec function, ExecCommandError class, and type definitions (ExecOptions, ExecResult)\n\n### Learnings\n\n**Patterns discovered:**\n- execa v9 exports: `execa`, `Options`, `ExecaError` from main module\n- execa's Result type has stdout/stderr that can be `string | unknown[] | Uint8Array` depending on stdio options\n- When using `stdout: \"pipe\"` and `stderr: \"pipe\"`, the outputs are strings but TypeScript doesn't narrow the type\n- Type guards (`typeof x === \"string\"`) are needed to safely convert execa results to our typed interface\n- Following the pattern from logger.ts: JSDoc comments, clear exports, re-export the base library for advanced use\n- Simple command parsing: `command.split(\" \")` works for basic cases (more complex parsing can be added later if needed)\n\n**Gotchas encountered:**\n- execa v9 doesn't export `ExecaReturnValue` type - it's called `Result` instead\n- The `Result` type is generic and complex - easier to let TypeScript infer it and use type guards\n- `error.stdout` and `error.stderr` in ExecaError can be arrays/Uint8Arrays, not just strings\n- Need to provide fallback values (`?? 0`, `|| \"\"`) to ensure our interface has non-undefined values\n- Command string must be split into command and args array for execa - can't pass whole string directly\n\n**Solution:**\n- Used type guards to ensure stdout/stderr are strings in both success and error cases\n- Let TypeScript infer the execa result type rather than explicitly typing it as `Result`\n- Created a strongly-typed `ExecCommandError` class that extends Error with command details\n- Added re-export of `execa` for advanced use cases that need more control\n\n---\n## ✓ Iteration 4 - US-004: Create exec utilities with execa wrapper\n*2026-01-19T11:21:34.293Z (167s)*\n\n**Status:** Completed\n\n**Notes:**\ns strings\\n4. ✅ Throws typed errors on failure - ExecCommandError class with command, exitCode, stdout, stderr properties\\n5. ✅ bun run typecheck passes - Verified: no TypeScript errors\\n6. ✅ bun run lint passes - Verified: 15 warnings from existing files, 0 errors\\n7. ✅ bun run format passes - Verified: format check passed\\n\\n✅ **Additional requirements:**\\n- Committed with message: \\\"feat: US-004 - Create exec utilities with execa wrapper\\\"\\n- Learnings documented in .ralph-tui/progress.md\\n\\n\n\n---\n","numLines":187,"startLine":1,"totalLines":187}}}
