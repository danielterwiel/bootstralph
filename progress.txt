**Task**: Verify Next.js incompatibility rules are complete
**Check**: Can Next.js actually use React Router? Are there edge cases where TanStack Router works with Next.js?

**Finding**:
- React Router CAN technically be used in Next.js but loses SSR/SEO benefits and is not recommended
- TanStack Router conflicts with Next.js History API - workarounds exist (memory history, route groups, patching) but you lose SSR benefits
- The incompatibility rules in PLAN.md are correct: Next.js should not use TanStack Router or React Router as primary routing

**Action Required**: None - the PLAN.md incompatibility rules are accurate

**Task**: Verify TanStack Start + RSC compatibility status
**Check**: Is RSC support still 'coming soon' or has it shipped? Check TanStack changelog

**Finding**:
- RSC support is still "coming soon" as of January 2026
- TanStack Start v1 is in Release Candidate stage (feature-complete, API stable)
- Official docs state: "we are actively working on integration and expect to support them in the near future"
- RSC will land as a non-breaking v1.x addition
- TanStack is taking a measured approach to ensure RSC integration aligns with type-safety and flexibility principles
- Server Functions already support returning JSX/elements from createServerFn

**Action Required**: None - the PLAN.md statement "rsc: Not yet supported (coming soon)" is accurate

**Task**: Verify Expo + Vitest incompatibility
**Check**: Is vitest-react-native mature enough now? Check latest status

**Finding**:
- vitest-react-native is NOT production-ready - the package explicitly warns "This package is still WIP"
- Current version is only 0.1.5 with no official releases, only 76 GitHub stars and 5 forks
- Community feedback describes it as "not very reliable" with testing-library functions like `getByTestId` and `getByText`
- Combining React-Native-Testing-Library + React-Native + Expo + Vitest is described as "an endless pit of issues"
- React Native Testing Library maintainers state they "try not to add any code that would force running on Jest" but haven't tested vitest-react-native themselves
- The main Vitest framework is at v4.0.17, but vitest-react-native remains experimental

**Action Required**: None - the PLAN.md incompatibility rules are correct: Jest is required for React Native/Expo, and Vitest should only be used for web projects

- https://www.npmjs.com/package/vitest-react-native/v/0.1.5

**Task**: Verify Uniwind stability
**Check**: Is Uniwind production-ready or still in beta? Check release status

**Finding**:
- Uniwind IS production-ready - official docs explicitly state "Both versions are production-ready and actively maintained"
- Current version is v1.2.4 (released January 13, 2026)
- Repository created July 29, 2025, now has 1.2k GitHub stars and 21 releases
- Offers 2x performance improvement over NativeWind
- HeroUI Native has fully migrated to Uniwind, reporting 250% performance boost
- Both free (MIT license) and Pro ($99/seat/year with C++ engine) versions available
- Built by the creators of Unistyles, a proven React Native styling solution

**Action Required**: None - the PLAN.md recommendation of Uniwind as default mobile styling is appropriate

**Task**: Verify oxfmt alpha stability
**Check**: oxfmt is listed as alpha - is it stable enough for default recommendation?

**Finding**:
- Oxfmt is currently in alpha (announced December 1, 2025) with beta ETA Q1 2026
- Current version is v0.24.0 (January 12, 2026) with active weekly releases
- Passes 95% of Prettier's JavaScript and TypeScript tests
- 30x faster than Prettier, 3x faster than Biome
- Professionally maintained by VoidZero/Oxc team with frequent bug fixes
- SST's opencode has added experimental oxfmt support, indicating real-world adoption
- Will be integrated into Vite+ as `vite fmt` (public preview early 2026)
- For CLI scaffolder targeting developers wanting cutting-edge tools, oxfmt is reasonable default

**Action Required**: Consider adding Prettier as explicit fallback option for users who need 100% stability. Current PLAN.md recommendation is acceptable.

**Task**: Check Universal platform flow logic
**Check**: If user selects Universal, we auto-select Expo + Tamagui. But should we ask about styling?

**Finding**:
- The wizard SHOULD ask about styling for Universal platform, not auto-select Tamagui
- While Tamagui is the best option for true universal apps (75k weekly downloads, optimizing compiler, extracts CSS on web), there are valid alternatives:
  - **NativeWind** (403k weekly downloads) - Familiar Tailwind approach, larger community, compiles utilities ahead of time
  - **Gluestack UI v3** - Combines NativeWind's styling engine with accessible, unstyled components
- Teams already using Tailwind may strongly prefer NativeWind over Tamagui's unique syntax
- Tamagui has a steeper learning curve that may not suit all teams
- Auto-selecting Tamagui ignores these valid use cases

**Action Required**: Update PLAN.md to:
1. For Universal platform, ask styling question with options:
   - Tamagui (Recommended) - Best performance, comprehensive design system
   - NativeWind - Familiar Tailwind approach, larger community
   - Gluestack UI - NativeWind + accessible components
2. Update wizard flow description to show styling is NOT auto-selected for Universal

**Task**: Check Astro + Auth flow
**Check**: Astro uses React islands for auth - is the UX clear that auth only works in islands?

**Finding**:
- The premise of this review was INCORRECT - Astro authentication does NOT only work in React islands
- **Clerk** has a native Astro SDK (`@clerk/astro`) with server-side middleware, route protection, and Astro components
- **better-auth** also supports server-side authentication in Astro without requiring React islands
- Both providers use `clerkMiddleware()` / auth middleware for route protection that runs server-side
- React islands are optional - primarily for interactive UI components (login buttons, user menus)
- The PLAN.md line "auth: better-auth, Clerk (via React islands)" was misleading

**Action Required**: Updated PLAN.md Astro section to clarify:
- Changed "auth: better-auth, Clerk (via React islands)" to "auth: better-auth, Clerk (native Astro SDKs with server-side middleware)"
- Updated note to "Use React islands for interactive UI; auth works server-side via middleware"
