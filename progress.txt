**Task**: Verify Next.js incompatibility rules are complete
**Check**: Can Next.js actually use React Router? Are there edge cases where TanStack Router works with Next.js?

**Finding**:
- React Router CAN technically be used in Next.js but loses SSR/SEO benefits and is not recommended
- TanStack Router conflicts with Next.js History API - workarounds exist (memory history, route groups, patching) but you lose SSR benefits
- The incompatibility rules in PLAN.md are correct: Next.js should not use TanStack Router or React Router as primary routing

**Action Required**: None - the PLAN.md incompatibility rules are accurate

**Task**: Verify TanStack Start + RSC compatibility status
**Check**: Is RSC support still 'coming soon' or has it shipped? Check TanStack changelog

**Finding**:
- RSC support is still "coming soon" as of January 2026
- TanStack Start v1 is in Release Candidate stage (feature-complete, API stable)
- Official docs state: "we are actively working on integration and expect to support them in the near future"
- RSC will land as a non-breaking v1.x addition
- TanStack is taking a measured approach to ensure RSC integration aligns with type-safety and flexibility principles
- Server Functions already support returning JSX/elements from createServerFn

**Action Required**: None - the PLAN.md statement "rsc: Not yet supported (coming soon)" is accurate

**Task**: Verify Expo + Vitest incompatibility
**Check**: Is vitest-react-native mature enough now? Check latest status

**Finding**:
- vitest-react-native is NOT production-ready - the package explicitly warns "This package is still WIP"
- Current version is only 0.1.5 with no official releases, only 76 GitHub stars and 5 forks
- Community feedback describes it as "not very reliable" with testing-library functions like `getByTestId` and `getByText`
- Combining React-Native-Testing-Library + React-Native + Expo + Vitest is described as "an endless pit of issues"
- React Native Testing Library maintainers state they "try not to add any code that would force running on Jest" but haven't tested vitest-react-native themselves
- The main Vitest framework is at v4.0.17, but vitest-react-native remains experimental

**Action Required**: None - the PLAN.md incompatibility rules are correct: Jest is required for React Native/Expo, and Vitest should only be used for web projects
